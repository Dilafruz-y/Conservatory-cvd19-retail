## **Background**

This project looks at the state of retail sales  during the COVID-19 pandemic. The project focuses on the period between January 2020 and August 2020. 

As it is evident that the economy is battered as a result of the unfortunate pandemic, the project investigates trends in sales to highlight those areas that have been gravely affected and those that seem to thrive. In addition, lock-down  public health policy implemented by the government changed the way business is conducted. As a result of the measure, the project also looked at a general trend in e-commerce activities with particular focus on the food sector, especially grocery shopping. The assumption is that food becomes a top priority as it is most needed to survive and endure the lockdown measure.

To effectively perform the necessary data analysis, the project is divided into 5 sections:

* Section 1: COVID-19 Confirmed Cases
* Section 2:  Retail Categories Sales
* Section 3:  E-Commerce
* Section 4: Retail Grocery
* Section 5: E-Grocery
